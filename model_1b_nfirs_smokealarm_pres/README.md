Xianghui Dong

The target variable created according to [model document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJN-QwLVqFHOvrRNtW2KEAkNZ-PuFiqTwa8y3iXx1Sg/edit).

	Measure 2: model  (Jonathan / Andrew)
	target variable: % of fire incidents within a region that didnâ€™t have smoke detectors (Xianghui create variable, push to J / A for model)
	all fire incidents in a region(tract), how many didn't have smoke detectors?

	My previous analysis of smoke alarm presence information in NFIRS data
- model_1b.Rmd
	R code for calculating the variables. It 
	- reading NFIRS original data
	- filter home fires
	- merge with valid geocoded address
	- interpret fire detector field and count all the home fires whether smoke alarm was present for each Census tract
- alarm_presence_by_tract.csv
	result for each year and combined.
- Later there will be a visualization report showing the target variables and other NFIRS data information in map.
